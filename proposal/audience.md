This tutorial is for people who want to learn how to leverage the power of the
CPython C API to write extension modules for their Python projects. Students
should be comfortable with Python and the builtin Python data structures like
dict, list, and tuple. We will cover the core C concepts needed for the CPython
API; however, students should be familiar with the C programming language and be
comfortable with its syntax. Students should leave the tutorial with the ability
to implement functions and classes in C. After the tutorial, Students should
understand the core CPython API and know how to navigate the
documentation. Students will learn when a C extension is needed at all and the
costs of introducing C to a codebase. Finally, students will see some common
mistakes and learn C extension specific debugging techniques.
